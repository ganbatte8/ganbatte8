Hello, I've been programming in C and C++ since 2019.

I have pushed a few public repositories to show off some code to employers.
- [boot.dev RSS aggregator (HTTP client) in Golang and PostgreSQL](https://github.com/ganbatte8/gator) (2025)
- [Chess game and bot in C++](https://github.com/ganbatte8/chess) (2021)
- [Project Euler sample solutions in C](https://github.com/ganbatte8/project-euler) (2021)
- [HTTP server from scratch in C++](https://github.com/ganbatte8/http-server) (2020)
